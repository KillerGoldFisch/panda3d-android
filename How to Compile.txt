Before we start, we should get the android ndk environmnet running.
We consider you already have:
   - android-sdk-linux folder
   - android-ndk-r* folder
   - Eclipse and Native Activities working
   

1. I build a set of scripts to automatize the process of building the
shared libraries. The user configs can be found in the user.config file.
It's used throughout the scripts.

	1.1. You MUST edit this file to your own configurations, paths etc.
   


2. We now need to get a toolchain. I tried to use the ones directly 
accessible through the ndk, but had some errors. So, I created a separate
toolchain to work with.

   2.1. In some builds, the script that makes the standalone toolchain
        have some errors. So, in this folder you will find the file
        make-standalone-toolchain-fixed.sh
        
        You can rename that file and put it as your: 
           $ndk_path/build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh
           
   2.2. Now we can create the toolchain by running the script:
        ./create-toolchain.sh
        

3. We can now try to compile panda to our chosen android platform. The
script ./build-panda3d.sh assumes a complete build (slow). A better 
script can be provided later, but when facing an error, the user can 
inspect the contents of the script and adjusts the actions made. 

So, run the: ./build-panda3d.sh

As a result you will get a libp3android.so that you can install where you
desire. By default it install on the path defined in user.config.
